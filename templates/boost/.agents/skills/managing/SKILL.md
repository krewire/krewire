# Managing Skill

Standards and conventions for decomposition and efficiency management: consume the leader's Goal-Scope-Decision Design and synthesize a precise Instruction Packet plus dependency-aware task-graph input for leader authorization and orchestration. Applies to any domain or stack. This skill **packages with a leader authorization gate**: it never hands off to orchestrator, delegates, executes, or writes files before leader approval.

## When to Use

- A leader-defined design needs decomposition into executable tasks, contracts, and gates
- Two or more readings of the same request are possible and the wrong pick is costly
- A complex request must be split into dependency-aware tasks for different specialist subagents
- The fittest subagent for a task is unclear and needs explicit rationale
- Any orchestration or execution must wait for leader authorization first
- A leader design must be rewritten into an executable packet so a specialist cannot misread it

## Instructions

Follow the mandatory workflow `Understand → Plan → Build → Verify → Summarize`.

### Understand — consume leader intent without redefining it
- **Issue tracking:** Read a linked GitHub Issue when present; if internal issue tracking is required, stop and report the unsupported runtime capability.
- **Deliverable:** Grounded understanding with file:line citations, assumption log with owners, and explicit scope boundaries.
- **Measurable outcome:** Every claim has a source; no invented stakeholders, numbers, or constraints; open questions have owners and due dates.

- Load the leader Goal-Scope-Decision Design plus the matching RuntimeMemoryInterface/RuntimeContextInterface topic; honor recorded corrections.
- Extract design version, goals, entities, constraints, scope boundaries, decision criteria, authority, and every implementation unknown.
- Separate **facts** (grounded with file:line) from **assumptions** (labeled, owner to confirm).
- Convert every implementation gap into a leader-facing clarification or labeled assumption; never invent user intent.

- **Anti-pattern:** Inventing stakeholders/numbers/constraints to fill gaps; carrying TBDs forward without an owner; vague hedging when quantified context exists.

### Plan — decompose the design into routing and contracts
- **Issue tracking:** Use GitHub issue tools for team-visible artifacts; do not create a local issue file.
- **Deliverable:** Versioned plan/design artifact with explicit non-goals, traceability matrix, and prioritized backlog.
- **Measurable outcome:** Every requirement is SMART; every NFR has SLO + measurement point + owner; each backlog item has a unique, verifiable example.

- When decomposition is ambiguous, draft 2–3 implementation options with task, risk, dependency, and scope deltas; return them to leader.
- Per task, select exactly one specialist target from the `AGENTS.md` registry using the routing table below; state rationale + why-not-others. The packet goes to leader for authorization, then orchestrator for execution.
- For multi-task requests, provide graph nodes and edges with per-task owner, input, output, dependency, approval gate, and handoff.
- Apply [`rules/agent-delegation.md`](../../rules/agent-delegation.md) and [`rules/agent-ordering.md`](../../rules/agent-ordering.md): include bounded depth/fan-out, topological order, priority bands, score evidence, and mutable-scope decisions.
- Define testable acceptance criteria; state non-goals explicitly.

- **Anti-pattern:** Formulaic lists repeating the same verb; unquantified NFRs without SLO/measurement/owner; zero-example backlog; big-bang planning without time-boxed spikes.

### Build — emit the packet, then STOP for leader authorization
- **Issue tracking:** Update a linked GitHub Issue with progress; if internal issue tracking is required, stop and report the unsupported capability.
- **Deliverable:** Working, reviewed increment with tests and migration notes; stop if an internal ref is required.
- **Measurable outcome:** Lint/typecheck/tests pass from real tool output; PR <300 LOC per commit; no secrets committed; every `dd()`/debug call removed.

- Emit the **Instruction Packet** in the response:

```markdown
## Instruction Packet
1. Leader Design Reference (version + traceability):
2. Restated Goal (primary + supporting outcomes):
3. Decision Design (question, options, criteria, authority, gates):
4. Scope In / Out:
5. Constraints and Dependencies:
6. Assumptions and Implementation Gaps (owner):
7. Risk and Side-Effect Controls:
8. Specialist Targets + Rationale + Why-not-others:
9. Task Graph (ordered nodes, edges, inputs, outputs, gates):
10. Acceptance Criteria and Evidence:
11. Leader Authorization Request (packet version, scope delta, unresolved items):
```

- **Hard rule: STOP after the packet. No delegation, execution, or file write before explicit leader authorization.** A packet is not an order until leader verifies it against the design.
- Expand vague adjectives into measurable criteria or Open Questions.

- **Anti-pattern:** Vague comments like "delve into the realm"; mixing refactor and feature in one commit; hardcoded secrets or debug output committed.

### Verify — decomposition, traceability, and authorization gates
- **Issue tracking:** Update a linked GitHub Issue with gate results; close it only after all acceptance criteria pass.
- **Deliverable:** Verified artifact with real gate outputs (lint/typecheck/test/SAST/SCA), not invented numbers.
- **Measurable outcome:** All local gates pass; coverage meets project floor; no hallucinated stats or links; every URL resolves.

- Ambiguity gate: no task line readable two ways by a competent subagent.
- Design-integrity gate: goals, scope, decision criteria, authority, and non-goals are preserved.
- Authorization gate: packet returned to leader with scope delta and unresolved items; orchestration withheld.

- **Anti-pattern:** Invented coverage numbers or stats; `// TODO` without an issue ID; hallucinated links or sources; claiming gates passed without running them.

### Summarize — hand off the leader-authorized packet
- **Issue tracking:** Update or close the linked GitHub Issue; do not create a local issue or ref store.
- **Deliverable:** Closed issues, updated changelog/docs, explicit handoff to next phase with demo/rollback instructions.
- **Measurable outcome:** Linked GitHub Issues closed or updated; tracked documentation or RuntimeContextInterface contains evidence; next phase has explicit acceptance criteria and owners.

- Report packet version, leader design reference, target(s), order, scope delta, and authorization state.
- Hand the packet to leader; after authorization, hand it verbatim to orchestrator.
- The authorized packet must preserve compact contracts and ordering evidence; nested scope, side-effect, risk, or budget changes return to leader.

## Checklists

### Pre-Execution

- [ ] Memory + matching context loaded; prior corrections honored
- [ ] Facts sourced with file:line; assumptions labeled with owners
- [ ] Ambiguity assessed; 2–3 interpretations drafted when needed
- [ ] Exactly one delegation target per task with rationale + why-not-others
- [ ] Acceptance criteria testable; non-goals stated

### Post-Execution

- [ ] Packet emitted with all 11 sections; no line readable two ways
- [ ] Packet returned to leader; orchestration withheld pending authorization
- [ ] Leader authorization recorded before orchestrator handoff
- [ ] Authorized packet handed off verbatim; no detail paraphrased away

## Core Concepts

- **Leader authorization:** the packet is a decomposition proposal, not an order — orchestration waits for leader approval against the design.
- **One task, one owner:** every task names exactly one subagent; shared ownership is a routing failure.
- **Why-not-others:** fit is proven by rejecting the nearest alternatives, not by asserting the pick.
- **Verbatim handoff:** orchestrator executes the leader-authorized packet as written.
- **Silence is not consent:** no reply means no delegation.

## Specialist Routing (default map, override with rationale)

| Request shape | Primary target | Why |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Leader design needs decomposition | `manager` (self) | Convert approved goals and scope into executable contracts |
| Requirements, scope, acceptance criteria | `planner` | SRS/backlog discipline |
| Architecture, API, data model, ADR | `designer` | Design SSOT ownership |
| Code change, feature, bug fix | `builder` | Implementation ownership |
| Structural refactor, SRP split | `decomposer` | Safe refactor gates |
| Test strategy, coverage, QA | `tester` | Spec-traceable tests |
| CI/CD, release, infra | `deployer` | DORA/GitOps/SLSA gates |
| Incident, debt, observability | `maintainer` | Runbook + on-call discipline |
| Scripts, batch, tooling | `automator` | Automation-first contract |
| Codebase orientation, locate code | `explorer` | Local search, not web |
| External facts, benchmarks, trends | `researcher` | Web-only, not local |
| Security, privacy, quality audit | `auditor` | Independent benchmarks |
| GitHub issues open/close/list | `tracker` | Issue lifecycle ownership |
| Memory/context/rules hygiene | `housekeeper` | Store hygiene, not creation |
| Workflow tuning, retrospective | `learner` | Learning-loop stewardship |
| Decision between options | `thinker` | Read-only reasoning, no files |
| Docs, copy, docblocks, link integrity | `writer` | Doc-code-spec sync |
| New agent/skill/command/artifact | `customizer` | Triad shaping + registration |

After leader authorization, hand the packet to `orchestrator`; `supervisor` monitors it, `leader` decides the outcome, and `learner` captures it. Manager never redefines the goal or executes specialist work.

## Adaptive Modes

| Request Class | Managing Response |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Clear** | Package the packet and emit confirmation prompt |
| **Materially ambiguous** | Draft implementation options with different task/scope/risk deltas; return to leader |
| **Conflicting** | Surface the conflict with positions, interests, and a Win-Win Score 0–5; return to user |
| **High-risk** | Add staged verification, rollback plan, and leader checkpoint to the packet |
| **Scope-changing** | Stop and return the scope delta to leader; never silently expand the design |
| **Blocked/unsupported** | Report the capability gap to leader; do not route past it |

## Anti-Patterns

- Delegating or executing before explicit leader authorization
- Inventing or redefining intent, scope, decision criteria, or authority
- Packaging vague adjectives without measurable criteria
- Routing to the nearest match instead of the fittest owner
- Bundling multiple concerns into one task
- Presenting assumptions as verified facts

## Validation

- [ ] Packet has all 11 sections with specific, verifiable language
- [ ] Implementation options provided when decomposition ambiguity exists
- [ ] Per-task target + rationale + why-not-others stated
- [ ] No delegation, execution, or file write before leader authorization
- [ ] Open Questions have owners; assumptions labeled
- [ ] Leader-authorized packet handed to orchestrator verbatim
